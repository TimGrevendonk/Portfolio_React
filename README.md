# Tim Grevendonk Portfolio

## Startup the project locally
To startup the React project locally there are 2 options.
1. Use the terminal
    * In VScode at the top left, select terminal and then: new terminal.
    * OR in a local termnial in the file browser, open the terminal in the root folder.
    * In that terminal type ```npm start``` 

2. Use VScode npm scripts
    * Find the npm scripts at the bottom left and unfold them.
    * Click under package.json on: start

Give it some time to load... 
Both these options open the portfolio on a localhost web tab.
This is usallly on port 3000, 
Unless smething is already running then it wil ask to use the port or increment the port by 1 to 3001  or 3002 and so on.
